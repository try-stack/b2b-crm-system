## Project Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ globals.css      # Global styles and Tailwind imports
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layout.tsx       # Root layout with metadata
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ page.tsx         # Main dashboard page
â””â”€â”€ public/              # Static assets
```

## Development

The main application logic is in `src/app/page.tsx`, which contains:

- **Header Navigation** - Main navigation with CRM sections
- **Metrics Dashboard** - Key performance indicators cards
- **Activity Feed** - Recent business activity timeline

You can start customizing by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file thanks to Next.js hot reloading.

- **Vercel** (recommended for Next.js)
- **Netlify**
- **AWS Amplify**
- **Docker containers**

For Vercel deployment:
